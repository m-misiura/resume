## <i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i> Experience

`2024-Now`
**Machine Learning Engineer**, [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), *Newcastle upon Tyne*

- Member of the [AI Safety team](https://trustyai.org/docs/main/main) for [the Red Hat Openshift AI platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/ai/openshift-ai), focusing on the development and implementation of safety measures for large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems:
  - [engineered](https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/guardrails-detectors) and [productionized](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-model-controller/blob/incubating/config/runtimes/hf-detector-template.yaml) a KServe serving runtime to streamline the deployment and management of LLM guardrails, directly enhancing the safety capabilities of the Red Hat OpenShift AI platform.
  - developed [a novel safety provider](https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/llama-stack-provider-trustyai-fms) for [llama stack](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack), integrating the IBM Research [FMS Orchestrator](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-guardrails-orchestrator) for content moderation; this component was officially adopted and included in [Red Hat's main Llama Stack distribution](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-distribution), 
  - co-led the integration efforts of NVidia's NeMo Guardrails into [Red Hat's LLM ecosystem](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/NeMo-Guardrails)
  - ran [a series of upskilling and mentoring sessions](https://github.com/m-misiura/nlp-skills) for engineers without prior experience in machine learning to increase the overall AI literacy within the team
  - delivered [a workshop on LLM safety and evaluation](https://m-misiura.github.io/workshop-evaluation-safeguarding-on-openshift/#/title-slide) for the IBM Research team at Trinity College Dublin
  - contributed to [the whitepaper on AI trustworthiness](https://ai4humanity.ai/pdf/GDC%20AI%20For%20Humanity%20Track%20Report%20-%20v2.0.pdf) as part the inaugural AI for Humanity Track at the [Global Digital Collaboration Conference](https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/agenda?day=2025-07-01)
  - invented a novel low-code framework to simplify and accelerate the implementation of AI guardrails, resulting in a filed US patent application

`2021-2024`
**Data Scientist**, [National Innovation Centre for Data](https://www.nicd.org.uk/), *Newcastle upon Tyne*

- [Headed a 4-month project](https://www.nicd.org.uk/case-studies/naimuri) for an intelligence and security organisation to train and validate a large language model with uncertainty quantification capabilities via novel entropy-based method 
- [Led a 3-month project for a digital marketing company](https://www.nicd.org.uk/case-studies/evolved-search) to modernise search engine optimisation strategies using embedding-based models and clustering techniques
- [Led a 3-month project for a software company](https://www.nicd.org.uk/case-studies/infotel-uk-consulting), developing a system to identify and anonymise personal data in legal documents
- [Managed an 18-month project for a large software company](https://www.nicd.org.uk/case-studies/sage), building explainable tree-ensemble and uplift models to reduce customer churn and enhance customer retention strategies
- Acted as a technical advisor on a [project about using deep learning to analyse chemical compounds ](https://www.nicd.org.uk/case-studies/akzonobel-nmr)
- Developed a prototype of a GenAI system for a legal company to summarise key information from legal documents as part of the conveyancing process
- Delivered a keynote talk on [Perspectives on Generative AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1RghyFW3yA) to a non-technical audience, explaining the opportunities and challenges of deploying generative AI systems in practice

`2018-2019`
**Data Scientist Placement**, [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk), *Newcastle upon Tyne*

- Contracted with the [the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board](https://ahdb.org.uk) to undertake an investigation into quantifying environmental impacts of the UK commercial livestock production systems over the last two decades
- Delivered a 10,000-word report, which should inform future government policy on identifying effective strategies to minimise environmental impacts of raising livestock

`2015-2016`
**Indirect Tax Analyst**, [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en.html), *Newcastle upon Tyne*

- Delivered tailored-made tax advice to clients from a variety of sectors including education, automotive, engineering and charity
- Improved technical writing skills by drafting engagement letters and client reports
- Demonstrated strong independent research skills and initiative by creating a large database of North East-based companies, which was utilised across regional offices for business development and client targeting
